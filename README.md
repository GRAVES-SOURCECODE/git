This is my own personal fork of git, containing random work-in-progress.

None of it is meant to make sense to anyone but me, unless and until I clean
it up and submit it upstream to the git community.

Some notes for myself:
  - [Project Ideas](personal-docs/project-ideas.md)
  - [Bugs to report and fix](personal-docs/bugs.md)
  - [Tools](personal-docs/tools.md)
  - [Submission Notes](./personal-docs/submission-notes.txt)
  - [Scripts](personal-docs/scripts/)
